## Installation

Go is simple to install. You can install it on a Mac with 

    brew install go

I'm on Arch Linux and go is available in the main repositories. [Packages][2] are available for most Linux distros and you can always [compile from source][3] if you want.

    pacman -S go

On Windows there is an [.msi installer][1].

After you've installed go you can get some help with 

    go help

## The inevitable Hello World

As with every programming language you'll want to run a hello world. Create a file 'hello-world.go' and add the code below.

    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
      fmt.Println("Hello World")
    }

You can run the code with 

    go run hello-world.go

You can also build your hello world program into a binary

    go build hello-world

You can now run the compiled code with 

    ./hello-world

Now time to start learning!
